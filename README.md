# Multi-Blockchain-Wallet

There are so many crypto coins out there so that there is a need to build out a system which can create them. Here is a command line tool, hd-wallet-derive that supports not only BIP32, BIP39, and BIP44, but also supports non-standard derivation paths for the most popular wallets out there today. Alos, python script has been integrated to act as "Universal" wallet which can manage billions of addresses across 300+ coins.
As a prototype, system has been tested for Ethereum and Bitcoin Testnet.
